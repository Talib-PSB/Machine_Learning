# Machine_Learning
Showcasing different type of classifiers in Machine Learning being train and testing of potholes 'survival' data. 
Pothole dataset obtained from kaggle.com and handcrafted to suit a simple binary output.
Features selections are based on the probability of survival if a path is taken by the road user.
Machine Learning Models Being Tested => Decison Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neigbour and Neural Network
Craft experiments were employed to assess the model, encompassing aspects like model convergence (speed of learning) and addressing overfitting (preventing the model from memorizing data). Employed techniques such as k-fold cross-validation and learning curves.
Experiments are instrumental in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the models. Convergence and overfitting are critical considerations.
Definatio of metrics were employed to evaluate themodel, such as precision, recall, and accuracy. Additionally, comparisons was done with alternative model, like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
Why it's important: Metrics facilitate an objective assessment of our model's performance. Comparisons with alternative models provide valuable context and insights into the quality of our solution.
